## Search Methods :
You can search for data on one or more French cities, using these different search methods:

|Search Method                           |Example                                    |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|D√©partement / Department                |`29, 45, 75, ...`                          |
|Nom de la ville / Name                  |`Brest, Orl√©ans, Paris, ...`               |
|Code Postal / Postal Code               |`29200, 45000-45100, 75000-75100-..., ...` |
|Num√©ro de Commune / Municipality number |`019, 234, 056, ...`                       |
|Arrondissement / Borough                |`1, 2, 1, ...`                             |
|Population / Population (2012)          |`142100, 113300, 2211000, ...`             |

> **Note:** The search by postal code **may not work** if it's a city that has **several postal codes** (such as Paris, Orl√©ans, Lyon, ...), in this case you must enter ALL the codes with a `-` between them!
## Obtained Result :
Normally following your search, you should obtain a list containing one or more city data lists!

Under the form : ` [{'D√©partement': '29', 'Nom reel': 'Brest', 'Code postal': '29200', 'Num√©ro de commune': '019', 'Arrondissement': '1', 'Population en 2012': '142100'}] `

## Export :

Following your search, the software offers to export the data in a new CSV file, and under the name of your choice!

> **Note:** When typing, you can add the filename extension `.csv` **OR NOT**, the program will add it for you in case you forget! ;)
### Full Export :
The software offers the option of exporting all the data for all French cities, but only taking into account the following descriptors:
- D√©partement / Department
- Nom de la ville / Name of the city 
- Code Postal / Postal Code
- Num√©ro de Commune / Municipality number
- Arrondissement / Borough 
- Population / Population (2012)

These are therefore useful descriptors for research, in order to reuse this file for future work!
### Targeted Export :
The second type of export is that which is targeted, for example admitting that you are looking for information on the department of Finist√®re (29), then you can export all the data of the cities of the department (and only them) in a `finistere.csv` file!
