## Search Methods :
You can search for data on one or more French cities, using these different search methods:

|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|Département / Department                |`29, 45, 75, ...`                          |
|Nom de la ville / Name                  |`Brest, Orléans, Paris, ...`               |

> **Note:** The search by postal code **may not work** if it's a city that has **several postal codes** (such as Paris, Orléans, Lyon, ...), in this case you must enter ALL the codes with a `-` between them!

Normally following your search, you should obtain a list containing one or more city data lists!

Under the form : ` [{'Département': '29', 'Nom reel': 'Brest', 'Code postal': '29200', 'Numéro de commune': '019', 'Arrondissement': '1', 'Population en 2012': '142100'}] `

## Export :

Following your search, the software offers to export the data in a new CSV file, and under the name of your choice!

> **Note:** When typing, you can add the filename extension `.csv` **OR NOT**, the program will add it for you in case you forget! ;)
